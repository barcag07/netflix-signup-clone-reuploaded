ATTENTION!   ATTENTION!   ATTENTION!   ATTENTION!   ATTENTION!   ATTENTION!   
This website was made to practice my web developing skills. Please DO NOT provide or reveal any real personal information. 

## Note on Repository Status
This repository was temporarily removed after mistakenly flagged as dangerous. The project is reuploaded to github with a live preview hosted from a different website to prevent being flagged in the future.

For this project I will try to recreate the html and css aspects of the Netlfix landing page and possibly other pages on the website. I hope to clone the website with html and css and eventually javascript. I will also make the clone responsive, but not at the moment.

### Current Pages Done/Work in Progress:
(Live Preview) [https://nfsignup.netlify.app/]
~ Landing Page (Click Netflix Logo)<br>~ Sign In Page (Click Sign In Button)

The target result was from the netflix website in 2023.
The official Netlfix website can be found at https://www.netflix.com/
