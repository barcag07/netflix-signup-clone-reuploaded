# Netflix-clone

ATTENTION!   ATTENTION!   ATTENTION!   ATTENTION!   ATTENTION!   ATTENTION!   
This website was made to practice my web developing skills. Please DO NOT provide or reveal any real personal information. If you would like to see my clone, press details If a warning appears and then click "visit this unsafe site". I made a ticket for the "report a detection problem", so until it is resolved this is my warning.



For this project I will try to recreate the html and css aspects of the Netlfix landing page and possibly other pages on the website. I hope to clone the website with html and css and eventually javascript. I will also make the clone responsive, but not at the moment.

Current Pages Done/Work in Progress:
~ Landing Page

The official netlfix website can be found at https://www.netflix.com/
